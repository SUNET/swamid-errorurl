<h1>Authentication error</h1>
<p>The service you tried to access failed during the authentication stage.
<p>This may be because it requires additional steps which did not occur during login (such as using a second factor). Please try again.
<p>If you cannot resolve the issue yourself, please contact support at your institution and include the name of the service you tried to access, any error information given by the service and, if possible, a screenshot of the error message at the service (including the address bar at the top of the web browser) and also of this message.
<p>The support of your organisation, DISPLAYNAME, can be reached at <a href="mailto:EMAIL">EMAIL</a>.
