<h1>Insufficient privileges</h1>
<p>The service that you tried to access requires privileges that you do not have.
<p>Typical requirements include:
<p><b>A <i>confirmed</i> user account, or "high" <i>identity assurance level</i> (AL)</b><br/>To confirm your user account, you need to visit IT Service Desk and identify yourself using your national ID card or passport.
<p><b>Affiliation</b><br/>Your <i>affiliation</i> describes your relationship with the Blue Star University. The set of attributes include for example <i>student</i> and <i>employee</i>. If you are a student and the service you tried to access did not receive the <i>student</i> affiliation, please contact IT Service Desk to correct this.
<p><b>Some specific entitlements</b><br/>Entitlements are specific privileges at specific services. If you are missing entitlements that you think you should have (e.g. you should be able to access this service), please contact IT Service Desk to resolve this.
<p>If you think you should have access, please contact support at your institution and include the name of the service you tried to access, any privileges that were noted as missing and, if possible, a screenshot of the error message at the service (including the address bar at the top of the web browser) and also of this message.
<p>The support of your organisation, DISPLAYNAME, can be reached at EMAIL.
